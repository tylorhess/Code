electric motors
	rotor = part that moves --> turns shaft --> delivers mechanical power
		permanent magnet (PM)
		coil/winding (iron core)
	stator = stationary part
		permanent magnet (PM)
		field coil/winding (iron core)
	commutator = mechanism used to switch current 
		self-commutated
		electronically (externally) commutated



1) magnetic - by far, the most common
2) electrostatic
3) piezoelectric

1) DC - now, more common
2) AC - used to be more common

1) synchronous
2) asynchronous motor = induction motor = AC motor

	induction requires: magnetic flux (changing magnetic field and/or moving conductor)

1) motor driver
	3.3V/5V  (0A) input signal(s) control: direction, speed/voltage, (and torque/current?)
	12V/24V (60A) power supply (input)
	0V to 12V/24V (60A) output to power motor
2) motor controller
	motor dirver + mirco controller



types:
	Brushed DC Motor (DC motor, Brushed Motor) = Electrically Excited DC Motor
		rotor: windings
		stator: 
			permanent magnet (PMDC motor) = low torque
			windings
				shunt = rotor & stator windings in parallel
				series = rotor & stator windings in series = high torque (highest torque:current b/c torque || current^2)
				compound = parallel & series (shunt & series)
				separately-excited = different power supplies (more flexibility)
		commutator: self-commutated (brushed)
		example: 2.007 simple, 2-wired, hobby motors
		power: DC
		control: rpm || V_emf, torque || current
		pros:
			inexpensive
			simple (easy to drive, no controller)
			available in all shapes and sizes
		cons:
			brushes wear down
			sometimes zero-torque position (brushes touching neither or both rotor windings)
			internal sparks (fire hazard with combustible gases)
			radio (RF) noise
		synchronous
		often geared
		V_applied - V_emf = I * R
		P_mech = I * V

	(Brushed) Universal Motor = AC Series Motor
		power: both AC and DC
		same as: DC Series Motor = Brushed DC Motor with rotor windings & stator windings in series using brushed commutator (self-commutated)
		except: modified slightly to operate on AC power too
		example: portable power tools, household appliances
		pros: lightweight, powerful, fast (faster than ACIM 60 Hz = 3600 rpm power line)
		cons: noisy, energy-inefficient: 30% (small) to 70% (large) 

	Brushless Motor (BL motor) = Brushless DC Motor (BLDM or BLDC motor) = Electronically Commutated Motor (ECM or EC motor)
		rotor: permanent magnet
		stator: windings
		commutator: electrically/externally commutated (controller/driver)
		example: hard drive (~10,000 rpm)
		power: DC
		control: 
			input? --> [motor controller/driver] --phase-shifted-waveforms--> torque (current control) OR rpm (voltage control)
						^-- <-- position <-- hall effect sensor <-- magnetic flux --'
		synchronous
		Stepper Motor
			steps = positions of magnetic equilibrium
			technically, all ECMs are "stepper motors"
			however, a "stepper motor" typically has teeth (~200)
				teeth increase the number of quantized/discretized steps (more than )
					
	 AC Induction Motor (ACIM) = AC Motor = Induction Motor
		rotor: conductive/inductive (squirrel cage)
		stator: windings
		commutator: electrically/externally commutated (AC current + simple circuit?)
		http://youtu.be/3GI-biC3aP8
		example: workhorse of industry (pumps, ...)
		power: AC
		control: phase-shifted sinusoidal waveforms (stator frequency/speed > rotor freq/speed)
		induction --implies--> asynchronous
			induction requires: magnetic flux (changing magnetic field and/or moving conductor)
			if synchronous (rotor speed = speed mag field changes), then mag flux = 0
			therefore: rotor must spin slower than the changing magnetic field
			thus: asynchronous
		cons: slow (<60 Hz = 3600 rpm power line)
	
	Brushless AC = Permanent Magnet AC (PMAC) = PM Synchronous Motor (PMSM)
		(AC Induction) x (Brushless DC) --> Brushless AC
		rotor: PM
		stator: windings
		synchronous 



	servomechanism (servo) - closed-loop, negative-feedback, motor+sensor control loop
		"servo motor" = any motor with a built-in sensor (typically: encoder)
