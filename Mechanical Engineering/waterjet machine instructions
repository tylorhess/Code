LMP OMAX instructions

design:
	0.003" fillets convex angles
	0.030" fillets concave angles (water jet stream diameter)
	non-filletted angles make the waterjet do weird things

arrive with:
	.DXF file 
		in INCHES
		saved to a USB
	printed dimensioned drawing (for reference)
	Requisition Form with account number and signature (from advisor or admin)
	material (stock)
		oversize stock by 3" on all sides (hobby shop = 0.5" on all sides)
		plastic and aluminum are fine
			ask Bill about anything else
			stainless steel = hazardous waste (has Chromium in it)
			copper is also bad

waterjet prep:
	turn on top water valve to the far right (NOT bottom valve = water on the floor)
	turn on air valve to the left behind the machine
		let Bill know if it doesn't get up 80 psi
	turn on air-related switch under the wooden table
	turn on black control knob to the right of the computer console
	turn on the desktop computer
	make sure there's enough garnet in the machine 
		don't let water touch anything that has to do with garnet
		don't add garnet while the machine is running (for fear of splashes)
	place stock in waterjet machine
		weigh stock down with lead blocks


running waterjet:
	don't save any files to the computer (save all the files to the USB)
	OMAX Layout
		import .DXF file
		Clean Up button
			repeat until all 3 categories are 0
		right-click Quality button
			set 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5
			1 = fast, rough
			5 = slow, precise
			usually 3 or 4
		Autopath
			check every feature to make sure jet is (inside/outside) feature
		(optional) add tabs using ???? button
			add tabs to anything less than 1" x 1" (really 2" x 2")
			maybe right-click something???
			ask Bill tab thickness/information (no formula, just trial-and-error)
		export/save as an .ODG file
	OMAX Make
		import .ODG file
		use arrow keys to jog the jet
			(arrow) = slow jog
			shift + (arrow) = rapid jog
			don't cross the lines (don't compress the accordion/bellows)
		set origin
		set material thickness
			add 0.010"-0.015" because it's old
		place the sponge around the nozzle
		set the z-axis (nozzle height)
			use the 0.060" calibration plate
				touch, then back off a quarter turn
		lock the z-axis (nozzle height) down
		raise water level over lead blocks
		print

after:
	test > jet
		place nozzle in between metal slots
		raise water???
		raise the nozzle 0.25" above the water
		press Test button 
		select jet option (water-only, no garnet)
		run water-only jet for 15 sec (to flush out the nozzle)
	shut down computer
	turn off controls knob after computer is completely shut down
	turn off air valve (this turns off the air switch automatically after <40psi)
	turn off water valve (very important)
	clean machine if we care...
