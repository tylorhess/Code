units = mm = millimeters (typically)

n = number of teeth
d = pitch diameter = diameter used if gears are modeled as rolling cylinders
		d = n * m
		d = n / p_in
c = pitch circumference
		c = 2 * PI * r
		c = PI * d
		c = n * p_mm

p_in = pitch in inches (imperial OR English) = teeth per inch along pitch circumference (similar to metric modulus)
     = 16, 24, 32, 48
		p_in = n / d
		p_in = 25.4 / m
p_mm = pitch in mm (metric) = arclength in mm of 1 tooth along pitch circumference
		p_mm = c / n 
		p_mm = PI * d / n
m = metric modulus (OR module) in mm
  = 0.3, 1, 2
		m = p_mm / PI
		m = d / n
		m = 25.4 / p_in
to match gears in inches, match their pitch (p_in) and pressure angle
to match gears in mm, match their module (and pressure angle?)

pressure angle = the angle between contact points of meshing teeth
			   = the angle between:
					the line tangent to pitch circumference
					the line normal to the gear surface at pitch circumference
				  OR
					the line normal to the pitch circumference (a radial line)
					the line tangent to the gear surface at pitch circumference
			   = common values (14.5, 20, 25)

gr = gear ratio
		gr = N_a / N_b (number of teeth)
		gr = C_a / C_b (pitch circumference)
		gr = D_a / D_b (pitch diameter)
		gr = 0_a / 0_b (0 = theta = angle = angular position)
		gr = w_a / w_b (w = omega = angular velocity)
	inverted:
		gr = t_b / t_a (t = tau = torque)

pinion = often the smallest gear in a gear drive train
	   = often the drive gear
